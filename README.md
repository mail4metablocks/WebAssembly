# WebAssembly
WASM execution engines such as Wasmer, WasmEdge and Wasmtime

WebAssembly (WASM) is a low-level, portable, binary instruction format that is designed to be executed in a web browser or in other environments that support the WASM runtime. WASM execution engines are software programs that provide the runtime environment for executing WASM code.

Wasmer is an open-source WASM execution engine that is written in Rust and designed to be easily embeddable in other software applications. It supports a wide range of features, including WASM multithreading, WebGL support, and the ability to run WASM code in parallel with native code.

WasmEdge is a WASM execution engine that is specifically designed for use in edge computing environments, such as IoT devices and edge servers. It is written in C and aims to be lightweight and efficient, with a focus on low-latency execution and fast startup times.

Wasmtime is another open-source WASM execution engine that is written in Rust and designed to be easily integratable with other software applications. It offers a variety of features, including support for running WASM code in parallel with native code, fast startup times, and the ability to run WASM code in a variety of environments, including the web, the command line, and cloud environments.

All of these WASM execution engines provide a runtime environment for executing WASM code, but they have different design goals and features, and may be more suitable for different use cases.
